## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code developed by Shubham Vats on 9/9/2023. The project aims to analyze the income of a data scientist over 7 months by calculating monthly interest rates using different Annual Percentage Rate (APR) values. The code computes various metrics such as average and mean APR, income before and after interest deduction, and generates visualizations including step plots of income values and monthly interest rates.

## Findings

1. Average and Mean APR
2. Imaginary Incomes of the Employee
3. Average Income
4. Cumulative Income
5. Step Plot of Income Values Before Interest Deduction
6. Step Plot of New Income Values After Interest Deduction
7. Step Plot of Monthly Interest Rates (r)

## Usage

To run the MATLAB code:

1. Open MATLAB environment.
2. Run the `IncomeAnalysis.m` script.

## Repository Structure

- `IncomeAnalysis.m`: MATLAB script containing the income analysis code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
